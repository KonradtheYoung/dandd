<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li><p> <strong> The Dungeon Master (DM) </strong> is tasked with creating the parameters of a campaign. This includes mapping out the terrain of the board, the objectives, placements of enemies, and general world-building. They are like a narrator, and use creative storytelling to bring their game world alive and make sense of the players' actions and dice-rolling. They also control the enemies in combat, rolling the dice for them. </p></li>
<li><strong> Storytelling </strong> <!--Make bold--> is a important to any campaign. A DM who fails to deliver an engaging story wastes not only their time, but everyone else's. They describe the setting of the campaign and explain important events, locations and objections as the players move their characters across the board. Much of this game revolves around creativity and imagination. A DM can make or break the immersion of a game. </p></li>
<li><strong> Characters </strong> are represented by figurines. You can buy official D&D figurines online or in some role-playing game (RPG) stores. However, alternatives can be used, ranging from action figures, to trinkets, to coins. Just make sure the visual representation of your character can fit within each of the squares that make up the board. </li> </p>
<li><strong> Skill Checks </strong> <!-- Make bold--> are secondary objectives that the DM can place in the environment. Each character has skills, such as Strength (how strong they are), Perception (awareness), and many others. To pass the "check," a certain number must be attained from the sum of a dice roll and Whatever level a character is in a certain skill. The DM can disclose the required skill needed to pass, or choose not to. For example, in a past campaign, Sir Konrad was walking through a dark forest at night. My DM said, "You hear something off in the distance. It could be the wind, it could be the enemy. You can request a Perception Check to investigate further." A fellow player had a Perception skill of 1, and rolled a 4. The DM responded, "It is probably nothing. Your character proceeds with ease." My character had a skill of 7, and rolled a 9. It turns out that a 15 was needed in order to hear the crouching bandits that were hiding behind the trees. My character hid safely behind a tree, while my companion was brutally slaughtered. </li></p>
<li><strong> Combat <!--Make bold--> </strong> is also important. Character classes determine which role a player will take in many circumstances. Some classes, like the Mage, use ranged magic attacks, whereas Warrior classes prefer close-range attacks. I like to play as a Rogue, using a combination of daggers and shruikens (throwing stars) to non-lethally subdue my enemies. Personally, I play characters with a high enough Charisma or Perception that I can talk my way out of dangerous situations, because every ally is one less enemy. And usually they have gold.
