<h2> Setting </h2>
<p> Welcome to Konradia, a small seaside kingdom wracked with civil war between two prominent factions, the Konradites, loyalist supporters of the ancestral dynasty, and the Anti-Konradists, rebel extremists who aim to topple the regime and execute King Konraad the Great. You and your party wash up on the shore after a shipwreck, lost in a strange new land. Will you help Konraad stay in power or send him to his untimely demise? The choice, is yours. Both sides have valid reasons and ideologies in this complicated conflict, and each character will determine where their allegiances lie. </p>
<h2> Factions </h2>
<h5>Konradites</h5>
<p> They control all the major port cities and supply lines. They value bravery and courage in battle, and will gladly give their lives for the Konraad they love. However, the regime is also very corrupt, and a large portion of their treasury goes directly into building golden statues of their beloved King. They tax the peasants, but also have a meritocracy that allows them to become rich. You can enlist in the Kon-Guard at any major city. The King promises amnesty to all the rebels when the war is over. </p>
<h5> Anti-Konradists </h5>
<p> Mostly peasants and criminals, after several prisons were emptied by the rebels. They fight for equally of all their citizens and wish to build a democracy. However, they are ruthless to their enemies and make it clear that no one loyal to the regime will be allowed citizenship, and will either be tried for treason or exiled once they take power. Many of them were formerly loyal to Konraad, and the King spends much of his weeping at their betrayal. You can enlist in most inland villages and towns. </p>
<h2> NCP's </h2>
<p> (Please note that creative liberties were taken in designing these NPC's. The DM can place enemies on any square, and choose to make them visible to the players via a figurine, or hide them under a Skill Check. You can also use generic characters from the handbook if you want to. IF you are joining an official/national D&D club, they will most likely use manual-generated NPC's. However, in local gaames, there is often more freedom alloted to the DM to make their own characters. The HP is amount of Health Points that a character has. Their Defense score corresponds to their armor/physical resistance; when you roll an attack die, the sum of the roll plus your base stat that you base your attack on, must be higher than their defense score to land a hit. For this campaign, I will let the DM decide how much damage the enemy attacks do to the players. Feel free to be as lenient or ruthless as you like.)
<h5> Konradite NCP's </h5>
<p> Kon-Guard: 30 HP, 10 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<p> Konraad the Great: 500 HP, 19 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<p> Kon-Guard Elite: 50 HP, 15 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<h5>Anti-Konradist NCP's </h5>
<p> Rebel infantryman: 20 HP, 5 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<p> Rebel archer: 15 HP, 5 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<p> Rebel commander: 50 HP, 10 Defense </p> <!--stats-->
<h5> Wildlife </h5>
<p> Land Shark: These nightmarish creatures are similar to regular sharks, except that they swim on land. They can reach speeds of 60 miles per hour (MPH) and their armored exoskeletons are nearly impenetrable. </p> <!--stats-->
<p> Skunk: Spawn of evil, these beasts release toxins that can blind an opponent for days. 50 HP, 5 Defense<!--stats-->
<p> Honey Badger: Malevolent demons from another realm, bent on leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in their wake. No living soul is safe from their terror. 100 HP, 3 Defense<!--stats--> </p>
<p> Moldy Cheese: The rebels recently pillaged several loyalist towns and slaughtered everyone. Left abandoned for so long, the local cuisine developed sentience. Releases spores that, once breathed in, turn its host into cheese factories, eating them from the inside out. Damages slowly drain health, magic, and stamina. 10 HP, 10 Defense <!--stats--> </p>
<p> Mortgage Loan: Exists with the sole purpose of destroying lives and eradicating even the slightest inklings of hope and happiness. Chases down characters and gives them bad dreams, shame, and malaise. Characters hit lose 1k gold every month, and skip every third turn due to indecision and existencial dread. This abomination can only appear once in the campaign, the first time a character rolls 0 on a Bartering check, or if they attempt to purchase any land owned by King Konraad, regardless of their base [Intelligence] skill. 1000 HP, 19 Defense <!--stats--> </p>
<p> Dragon: The legends were wrong, these are not majestic creatures that can fly or breath fire. Instead, these four-legged lizards are known to ambush their prey and paralyze them with venom. Characters hit lose 5 HP per turn, until the menace is defeated. 25 HP, 7 Defense </p>
<p> Rabbid Goat: Enough said. 15 HP, 10 Defense
<p> Hermit: Local villagers talk about a mysterious character who lives out in the woods. They say he conducts bizare rituals and hides on the outskirts of the forest, making wild animal noises. Some say he is a shapeshifter, others say he is pathologically insane. Knows who? 200 HP, 3 Defense </p>
<p> Werewoof: Under the light of the full moon, the afflicted are cursed with only being able to speak in "woofs." 20 HP, 5 Defense </p>
<p> Giant Spiders: Let's face it, you can't always afford to be the hero. Sometimes, it's just better to flee and hope your fellow characters are slower. 100 HP, 10 Defense </p>
<h5> Other </h5>
<p> Wounded Bandit: Recently raiding a rebel fortress, they are no longer as great a menace as they once were. Loses 1 HP per turn in addition to any damage dealt by players. 20 HP, 0 Defense <!--stats--> </p>
<p> Alternate Self: The DM will mark one or more of the spaces with a black X, but say nothing about it to any of the players. If a character lands on it out of curiosity, they will have to fight their alternate self, with the same stats as them. If they lose, they must roleplay as their alternate self for the rest of the campaign. If this happens, allow them to introduce the backstory of the new character. </p>
<h2> Grid </h2>
<p> Konradia exists place on a series of 20 by 20 <!--Not sure specifications by 5th ed. manual, consult the rule book for later!!!!--> space grids. Each grid represents 1 movement point. Locations include the main port city, the roads into the woods, peasant villages, and battlefields. If you do not own an official D&D board, you can make your own using a sheet of paper. </p>
