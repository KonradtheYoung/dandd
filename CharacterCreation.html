<p>Before you can play D&D, you must first create your character. The DM can make a character as well, in addition to narrating the story and controlling NPC's. There are many ways in which you can make your character truly unique.</p>
<h2>Race</h2>
<p>There are many fantasy races in D&D, including humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and many others. There are also hybrids, such as half-elves. Each race has its own physique and attributes that factor into gameplay. For example, an orc may be very strong by nature, and able to wield heavier weapons, whereas a dwarf might be very small and therefore good at sneaking past guards.</p>
<h2>Class</h2>
<p>Class determines what role your character will take among your traveling companions. Will you be a dagger-wielding rogue, swift and sneaky, or a loud-and-proud battlemage who never shies away from battle? Will you be a skilled ranger who snipes enemies from afar, or a pacificist cleric who heals teammaes and talks down foes? The choice is entirely yours, and adds another level of immersion to the experience. Campaigns featuring a diverse cast of characters of different classes can be very exciting, as mixed tactics often play in the party's favor.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Give your character a believable backstory. Where are they from? How was their childhood? How did they end up where they are now? The greatest thing about your character is that it is <strong>yours.</strong> Get as creative as you want in building your character. Otherwise, you are just moving a figurine across a grid, and that's no fun.</p>
<h2>Morality</h2>
Moral alignment is very important in D&D. This defines what kind of person your character is. Generally, there are two spectrums of morality in this game: Good-Evil and Lawful-Chaotic. A character is deemed good or evil based on how they view themselves in correlation to others. A character is deemed lawful or chaotic based on how they see themselves in correlation to society and order. There are nine distinct sub-categories of moral alignment in D&D. They inlcude:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Lawful Good: Goes out of their way to protect the innocent and uphold the rule of law.</li>
  <li>Neutral Good: Is a kind person and wants to do the right thing.</li>
  <li>Chaotic Good: Has good intentions but does not agree with much of society, and vice versa.</li>
  <li>Lawful Neutral: Respects and upholds the law.</li>
  <li>True Neutral: Nihilistic and unpredictable, true wild cards.</li>
  <li>Chaotic Neutral: Unhinged, bored, and often questionable. </li>
  <li>Lawful Evil: Believes the ends justify the means. </li>
  <li>Neutral Evil: The self is all that matters, anyone else is a pawn. </li>
  <li>Chaotic Evil: Wreaks havoc and destruction for its own sake, despicable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>These are your "stats." These range from Strength, used to determine how strong you are and how much damage heavy weapons can deal, to Perception, how well one can "read" a situation, and Intelligence, how smart someone is. Different races and classes have different starting attributes, but each can be improved by leveling up. The DM can place Skill Checks where they please, which allows open-ended scenarios that may play out differently for certain characters. These checks often make up the most suspenseful moments of the game, especially if your DM is rather creative. Like I said before, stortelling is a key aspect of this game.</p>
