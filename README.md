 <h1> A New Campaig </h1>
<!--This is my starting point for my client website. My brother's roommate is currently planning the details of the campaign, which I plan to partake in, and will manipulate my reluctant brother into playing as well. He is using the 5th Edition manual for the game parameters.-->
<p> Hello reader, welcome to my website. For my website project, I am making a client site for my brother's roommate Adam. For the most part, he is a fool, but one of his greatest redeeming qualities is that he has an open mind for turn-based role-playing games (RPG's). He was recently given the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) 5th Edition Manual as a gift, and has since asked me to join in his first campaign. Although I am not a D&D veteran, I have some experience.</p>
<h2> What is D&D? </h2>
<!--Go back later and add a yellow highlight or some other distinguishing attribute to mark this as a heading.-->
<p> For any newcomers of the game, D&D is a turn-based tabletop game. It is played on a board or grid, much like chess. Each player creates and controls a character of their choosing, in an open-ended adventure. The game is loosely-directed by the Dungeon Master, or DM, who sets up the game parameters and controls most of the enemies. Unlike games like chess, there is no way to "win," the game, and players work together. It is more about the experience of teamwork and pretending you are living in a fantasy world.</p>
<h2> Character Creation </h2>
<!--Same as above, make a secondary title.-->
<p> Before you can play the game, you must first create your character. There are several templates online, and in the manual, to help you. Players can choose their race, stats, and background, as well as customizing their character's personality to make them truly unique. You can also choose their morale alignment, ranging from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil. I personally find more ambiguous characters more interesting to play as, my last character, Sir Konrad, Lord of the Brave and Blade of the Bold, was of the Chaotic Good alignment, a dashing rogue who fought for the innocent but had a nasty habit of stealing soup from nobles after breaking into their house. All of these factors help the player create a character that is truly unique and personalized. </p>
<h2> Dungeon Master </h2>
<p> The Dungeon Master, or DM, is tasked with creating the parameters of a campaign. This includes mapping out the terrain of the board, the objectives, placements of enemies, and general world-building. They are like a narrator, and use creative storytelling to bring their game world alive and make sense of the players' actions and dice-rolling. They also control the enemies in combat, rolling the dice for them. </p>
<p> Storytelling <!--Make bold--> is a important to any campaign. A DM who fails to deliver an engaging story wastes not only their time, but everyone else's. They describe the setting of the campaign and explain important events, locations and objections as the players move their characters across the board. Much of this game revolves around creativity and imagination. A DM can make or break the immersion of a game. </p>
<strong> Skill Checks </strong> <!-- Make bold--> are secondary objectives that the DM can place in the environment. Each character has skills, such as Strength (how strong they are), Perception (awareness), and many others. To pass the "check," a certain number must be attained from the sum of a dice roll and Whatever level a character is in a certain skill. The DM can disclose the required skill needed to pass, or choose not to. For example, in a past campaign, Sir Konrad was walking through a dark forest at night. My DM said, "You hear something off in the distance. It could be the wind, it could be the enemy. You can request a Perception Check to investigate further." A fellow player had a Perception skill of 1, and rolled a 4. The DM responded, "It is probably nothing. Your character proceeds with ease." My character had a skill of 7, and rolled a 9. It turns out that a 15 was needed in order to hear the crouching bandits that were hiding behind the trees. My character hid safely behind a tree, while my companion was brutally slaughtered. </p>
<p> Combat <!--Make bold--> is also important. Character classes determine which role a player will take in many circumstances. Some classes, like the Mage, use ranged magic attacks, whereas Warrior classes prefer close-range attacks. I like to play as a Rogue, using a combination of daggers and shruikens (throwing stars) to non-lethally subdue my enemies. Personally, I play characters with a high enough Charisma or Perception that I can talk my way out of dangerous situations, because every ally is one less enemy. And usually they have gold. </p>

<h1> <!--Subpage--> A Sample Campaign </h1>
<h2> Setting </h2>
<p> Welcome to Konradia, a small seaside kingdom wracked with civil war between two prominent factions, the Konradites, loyalist supporters of the ancestral dynasty, and the Anti-Konradists, rebel extremists who aim to topple the regime and execute King Konraad the Great. You and your party wash up on the shore after a shipwreck, lost in a strange new land. Will you help Konraad stay in power or send him to his untimely demise? The choice, is yours. Both sides have valid reasons and ideologies in this complicated conflict, and each character will determine where their allegiances lie. </p>
<h2> Factions </h2>
<p> Konradites </p>
<p> They control all the major port cities and supply lines. They value bravery and courage in battle, and will gladly give their lives for the Konraad they love. However, the regime is also very corrupt, and a large portion of their treasury goes directly into building golden statues of their beloved King. They tax the peasants, but also have a meritocracy that allows them to become rich. You can enlist in the Kon-Guard at any major city. The King promises amnesty to all the rebels when the war is over. </p>
<p> Anti-Konradists </p>
<p> Mostly peasants and criminals, after several prisons were emptied by the rebels. They fight for equally of all their citizens and wish to build a democracy. However, they are ruthless to their enemies and make it clear that no one loyal to the regime will be allowed citizenship, and will either be tried for treason or exiled once they take power. Many of them were formerly loyal to Konraad, and the King spends much of his weeping at their betrayal. You can enlist in most inland villages and towns. </p>
