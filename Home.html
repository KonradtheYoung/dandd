  <p>I'm sure you have heard of it before. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a turn-based tabletop game, played on a board or grid, much like chess. For newcomers, this game is not only challenging, but intimidating. This game has a very high learning curve, and requires a great deal of patience and enthusiasm to master. Fear not newcombers (like Adam, my brother's roommate who I am making this website for in the first place), luckily I am here to ensure that your first D&D experience is not a total disaster. This website will help you learn the basics of the game, using parameters from the 5th edition handbook. Sorry if I embarassed you Adam, as you're not the only one reading this. Just know that there are many like you, so don't feel too bad about your initial lack of D&D knowledge, for I am here to help. </p>
      <p>Dungeons and Dragons is similar to many other board games, only a little (read: a lot) more complex. Each player creates and controls a character of their choosing, in an open-ended adventure. The game is loosely-directed by the Dungeon Master, or DM, who sets up the game parameters and controls most of the enemies. Unlike games like chess, there is no way to "win," the game, and players work together. Unlike other board games, D&D is more about the experience of teamwork and pretending you are living in a fantasy world, rather than "winning" any set objective. Have you ever watched a movie like the Lord of the Rings thought to yourself, "I wonder what I'd be like if I lived in a fantasy world?" If you answered "yes," this game is definitely for you. If not, pour over this website anyway and hopefully you will change your mind.</p>
